- Bitwise Operators:
  - Bitwise Complement(~)
    - 0 ka 1 and 1 ka 0
  - Left Shift(<<)
  - Right Shift(>>)

- Bitwise complement of 5: https://i.ibb.co/C0Xxkhd/bitwise-complement-of-5.png

- Left shift by 1 is multiplication by 2
- Right shift by 1 is division by 2

- Bitwise OR
- Bitwise AND
- Bitwise Exclusive OR

- sizeOf operator: This is actually a method atm
- Comma operator: int y=4,3,6 -> In this value of y will be 6
- Dot and arrow operator
- Casting operator
- & Address operator
- * Pointer operator

------------------------------
- Unary Operators
  - + -> Unary Plus
  - - -> Unary Minus
  - ++ -> Increment Operator
  - -- -> Decrement operator
  - ! -> Logical Operator

- Pre-increment and Post-increment operator

- Precedence and associativity
  - https://i.ibb.co/rtXjnt8/associativity-of-operators.png

- Points for the below image:
  - https://i.ibb.co/NWqDs92/problem.png
  - Precedence of unary operator is more than arithmatic operator
  - After that arithmatic operators associativity is from left to right

- What is the result of following code:
   Boolean p = false;
   Boolean q = false;
   Boolean r = true;
   cout<<(p==q==r)
Ans: (false==false==true) -> (true==true) -> true
